🔍 How a Firewall Filters Traffic

A firewall is like a security guard for your computer or network.
It controls which data packets (small pieces of information sent over the internet) are allowed in or out of your system.

🧠 How It Works

1.Packet Inspection

      ● Every time data tries to enter or leave your system, the firewall checks it.

      ● It looks at:

          ●  Source IP (where it came from)

          ●  Destination IP (where it’s going)

          ●  Port number (which service or app it’s for, like 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP)

          ●  Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.)

2.Rule Matching

      ● The firewall has a list of rules — for example:

         ● “Allow SSH on port 22”

         ● “Block Telnet on port 23”

      ● Each packet is compared to these rules.

3.Decision Making

      ● If a packet matches an “allow” rule, it passes through.

      ● If it matches a “deny” rule, it is blocked or dropped.

4.Logging

      ● Firewalls can log allowed and blocked packets.

      ● These logs help system administrators see what traffic is happening and detect attacks.

🧱 Types of Firewalls

● Packet Filtering Firewall – Checks IP, port, and protocol only.

● Stateful Firewall – Tracks active connections; more secure.

● Application Firewall – Filters specific app traffic (like web traffic, FTP, etc.).

⚙️ Example with Linux UFW
sudo ufw deny 23   # Blocks Telnet traffic
sudo ufw allow 22  # Allows SSH traffic


These rules control what kind of connections are permitted to your system.

✅ Conclusion

A firewall filters traffic by allowing trusted communication and blocking suspicious or unwanted connections.
It helps protect your system from hackers, malware, and unauthorized access by acting as a barrier between your computer and the internet.
